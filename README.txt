1. System requirements

	The code was developed using MATLAB R2022a and is compatible with any operating system.

	It has been tested on a previous MATLAB version (R2020a).
	
	No non-standard hardware is required.


2. Installation guide

	MATLAB is commercial software. You can find an installation guide at https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/install-products.html
	
	The installation process typically takes around 20 minutes.

	Once MATLAB is installed, no further installation is required for this code.


3. Demo

	The main file is "ABM_BMs.m," which automatically uses the data file "vasculature1.mat" and the functions "borders.m" and "ChooseNeighbor.m."

	Open "ABM_BMs.m" and run it directly. A single realization will take place, and a new window will appear, displaying the simulation, which only takes a few seconds.


4. Instructions for use

	The only required input data is the shape of the vasculature, located in the "vasculature1.mat" file.

	To run the code, simply follow the instructions in the previous section.

	To reproduce quantitative results, one hundred realizations were performed in each case. Initial parameters can be adjusted for different outputs.
